# Digital-Quote-Teller
The Digital Quote teller is a spin on the popular childhood game, Paper Fortune Teller, I used to play as a kid.  In this digital version, the user is prompted to choose a color and a number, and the program generates a personalized quote based on their selections. 
I used to play Paper Fortune Teller all the time as a child and thought to put my own spin on it by replacing the fortunes with my favorite quotes from tea bags I use all the time as an adult. 

Users enter their name, choose a color (red, blue, green, yellow), and select a number (1, 2, 3, 4). 
A curated list of inspirational quotes is available for users to receive unique and thoughtful messages. 
The combination of the chosen color and number determines the quote displayed to the user. 
The program validates user inputs, ensuring that the chosen color and number fall within the specified options. 
Users are prompted to re-enter their choices if they provide invalid input. 
The introduction of a while True loop allows users to play the game multiple times consecutively. 
After each round, the program prompts users if they want to play again. 
Entering 'yes' restarts the game, while any other input exits the program. 

Core Concepts Utilized: 
Loops (while), Conditional Statements (if), User Interaction (Input/Output), Functions, Lists, String Manipulation, Infinite Loop, Break Statement.
The  Digital Quote Teller offers an enjoyable and insightful experience, providing users with inspirational quotes while allowing them to replay the game as many times as they desire.
